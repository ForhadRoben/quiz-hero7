                    1.What is the difference between the map(), forEach(), filter() and find() array methods?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p class="mt-3">The map() method:
                        The map() method loops through each element in array and calls the provided function for each
                        element. This method returns a new array according to the provided callback function and doesn’t
                        change the original array.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-3">The forEach() method:
                        The forEach() method is also used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does
                        not returns a new array based on the given array and it returns undefined and not executed for
                        empty elements.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3">The filter() method
                        The filter() method returns the element that matches and removes the element that does not
                        match. filter() method search whole array from start to end and returns all the value which is
                        matched.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3">The find() method:
                        The find() method return the first value which match from the collection of array . find()
                        method search the array from the start if the desired value is matched then find() method return
                        that value and terminate and rest of the array is not process.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3">If we want the benefits of the return value or somehow we don’t want to
                        change the original array then proceed with the map() otherwise, forEach() could be the better
                        choice.

                        When more than one element is expected to be returned and we want to check all elements, then we
                        can use the filter() method. But if we expect only a single element to be returned from the
                        array, then we can use find() and avoid extra iterations.</p>

                        storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline

                        browser and system.</p>

                    3.How does JavaScript event loop work?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content">
                    <p class="mt-3">The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking
                        operations. When an asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the
                        task is completed, the event loop will again check for any other tasks that need to be
                        performed. This process will continue until all tasks have been completed.
                        Event loops are most often used in programming languages that are based on the event-driven
                        programming paradigm.Many graphical user interface (GUI) programs are written using the
                        event-driven programming paradigm, as are many video games.</p>
